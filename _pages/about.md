I am a **PhD Candidate** in **Economics** at <a href="https://ecares.ulb.be/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">ECARES (ULB)</a>.

My main field of research is **international trade**. I am also interested in industrial organization, labor, and development. 

My research agenda is supported by a grant from the <a href="https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">FRS - FNRS</a>. You can find my CV <a href="https://fabrizioleone.github.io/files/CV_Fabrizio_Leone.pdf" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">here</a>.

**In September 2024, I will join the Bank of Italy as a Research Fellow**.
